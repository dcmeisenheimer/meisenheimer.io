                    <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>

                    <p>I am currently a Junior in the Management Information Systems program. I have a diverse background from South Korea and the United States. I currently reside in Alabama. I started working in the customer service field at the age of 15 and started my own business at 18.</p>
                    
                    <p>I wanted to learn how to be self-sufficient at a young age. I learned how to target niche markets and grow healthy customer relations. My primary focus has shifted to retaining my customer base and ensure customer satisfaction. I enjoy researching and finding new opportunities. Iâ€™m always adapting to the changing landscape of current trends and new markets.</p>

                    <p>I have a passion for data security and want to explore better ways to protect our privacy. I have four years of managerial and customer service experience. I have a skill set in repairing/building hardware and software repair. Current languages I am learning are C#, JavaScript, HTML, Css, and SQL. I have experience in sales tracking, updating inventory, advertising, and consulting.</p>
